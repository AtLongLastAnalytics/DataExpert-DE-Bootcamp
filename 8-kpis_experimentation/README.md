# KPIs and Experimentation
### Data Engineering Bootcamp (from DataExpert) Week 8

The files herein are based on the bootcamp material created by Zach Wilson.
I have enriched the course notes by adding extensive narrative from my own experiences from working with data for 10 years

In this folder, you'll find:
1. [Decoding Business Success: Metrics, Growth, Strategies, and Collaborative Approaches](1-decoding_business_success.md)
    - Here, we explain how data engineers can drive business success by aligning metrics with experimentation and strategic decision-making.
    - The emphasisis is on the role of key performance indicators (KPIs) in shaping data models and guiding hypothesis testing, and an introduction to hypothesis testing.

2. [Leading and Lagging Metrics](2-leading_lagging_metrics)
    - Here, we discuss the difference beetween leading and lagging metrics, illustrating how each fits into product analytics and user funnels.
    - We discuss how data engineers can have larger impact by adopting a product manager mindset; enabling us to connect data insights with enhanced user experiences and long-term business outcomes.

3. [Homework](3-homework)
    - The problem statement asks us to pick a product, describe the user journey, and three experiments we wouldl like to run on this product to improve our experience.

4. [Homework Solution](4-homework_solution)
    - We discuss NBA League Pass (a premium streaming service offering live and on-demand access to NBA games and highlights). Our goal is to improve NBA League pass by adding more immersive and interactive elements into the streaming service.
    - We discuss three experiments, and for each we discuss a clear objective, defined test and control groups, specific test conditions, and hypotehses involving both immediate (leading) and long-term (lagging) metrics. The three experiments are:
        1. personalised content recommendations
        2. virtual watch parties for social engagement
        3. an initerractive statistics overlay
