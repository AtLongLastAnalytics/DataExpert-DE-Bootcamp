# NBA League Pass: User Journey and Experimentation Roadmap

## 1. User Journey

### **Onboarding and Discovery**
I first discovered NBA League Pass when I was looking for a way to watch all of the Los Angeles Lakers' games while in the UK. NBA League Pass dominated the market and with their clear advertisements and a straightforward sign-up process that made it easy for me to try their services. Signing up was straight forward, and the initial setup across multiple devices was seamless.

### **Early Experiences**
In the early stages of using NBA League Pass, a few aspects stood out to me:
- **Quality Streaming:** The streaming experience was smooth and I could watch live games in HD quality with no buffering.
- **Replays and Highlights:** Being able to quickly find and watch highlights let me atch up on missed games when I only had a few minutes to spare.
- **User Interface:** The design was clean and intuitive, making navigation between live games, replays, and other exclusive content easy.

### **Evolution Over Time**
Over time, NBA League Pass continued to impress me with their new features:
- **Personalized Content:** After a few weeks of using the app, the recommendations adapted to my interests and viewing history, making it easier to discover content I was interested in.
- **Cross-Device Integration:** Transitioning from TV to mobile was easy and perfect for when I was on the go and the experience was consistent across devices.
- **Interactive Features:** The inclusion of real-time statistics and box-scores meant I could keep up with multiple games whilst watching my team play.
- **Community Engagement:** Social features were added to help connect with like-minded users. Live chats were great to see how other people reacted to the same game in real-time.

## 2. Experimentation Roadmap

To further enhance NBA League Pass, I propose three experiments aimed at increasing engagement and improving the overall user experience. Each experiment includes details on test cell allocations, conditions, and anticipated impacts on key metrics.

### **Experiment 1: Personalized Content Recommendations**

**Objective**: Enhance user engagement by tailoring the recommended games and highlights based on individual viewing habits.

 **Test Design**
- Population: All active NBA League Pass subscribers.
- Test Allocation:
  - Control Group (50%): Users continue to see the current recommendation carousel.
  - Test Group (50%): Users see personalized recommendations generated by a machine learning algorithm that accounts for past viewing behavior; favorite teams, and game types (live, replay, highlights).

#### **Test Conditions**
- Control: Standard recommendation carousel.
- Test: A dynamic "For You" section that updates recommendations in real time (whilst the user is logged in) as per the user's interests.

#### **Hypotheses**
- Leading Metrics:
  - Increased click-through rate (CTR) on recommendation tiles.
  - Longer session durations on the home screen.
- Lagging Metrics:
  - Improved retention and subscription renewal rates.
  - Overall increased engagement measured by weekly active users.


### **Experiment 2: Social Viewing Experience â€” Virtual Watch Parties**

**Objective**: Build a stronger community and enhance engagement on live games by introducing a virtual watch party feature.

**Test Design**
- Population: Users who frequently stream live games.
- Test Allocation:
  - Control Group (70%): Users get the standard live streaming interface.
  - Test Group (30%): Users participate in a virtual watch party integrated into the streaming interface. This includes live chat, quick-chat emoji reactions, and real-time commentary.

**Test Conditions**
- Control: Standard live game stream without social interaction.
- Test: Enhanced interface featuring:
  - An integrated real-time chat window.
  - The ability to hoost/join friend groups or random watch parties.
  - Display of social metrics (e.g., reaction counts) during the game.

**Hypotheses**
- Leading Metrics:
  - Increased in-game session time.
  - Elevated frequency of live interactions (chat messages, reactions).
- Lagging Metrics:
  - Higher customer satisfaction and reduced churn.
  - Increased lifetime value reflected in consistent subscription renewal.

### **Experiment 3: Enhanced Interactive Statistics Overlay**

**Objective**
Improve the live game experience by overlaying interactive, real-time statistics and analytics for deeper insights.

**Test Design**
- Population: Users who regularly engage with in-game statistics and analytics.
- Test Allocation:
  - Control Group (60%): Users view the game with the current static overlay showing score and game clock.
  - Test Group (40%): Users experience an interactive overlay featuring:
    - Real-time player statistics and a curated set of advanced analytics.
    - Customizable information panels and interactive graphs.
    - Options for users to toggle specific data points on/off.

**Test Conditions**
- Control: Minimalistic overlay with only essential game details.
- Test: Rich, interactive overlay with customizable statistical displays.

**Hypotheses**
- Leading Metrics:
  - Higher interaction rates (clicks, hovers, toggles) with the overlay.
  - Increased engagement during live game segments.
- Lagging Metrics:
  - Higher customer satisfaction scores.
  - Improved retention as users derive additional value from insights provided.


## 3. Conclusion

The user journey for NBA League Pass has evolved from a simple, high-quality streaming service to an immersive, interactive platform enriched with personalized recommendations, social engagement, and real-time analytics. These proposed experiments aim to further enhance user engagement by addressing:
- **Personalized Content:** Making content discovery tailored and intuitive, easily exposing users to new content.
- **Social Viewing:** Fostering a community environment during live games for increased interaction.
- **Interactive Statistics:** Offering deeper insights that enrich the live experience. One aimed at the analytical viewers.

Properly allocating test and control groups for these experiments will provide valuable insights into user behavior. The leading metrics offer immediate feedback on user interaction, while lagging metrics will help gauge long-term impacts such as retention and subscription value. Each experiment is expected to inform design choices which have the potential to increase revenue.
